So I've been playing around with [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) a bit. I
dig it basically because I dig Javascript. Node is one of those
disruptive technologies that people either love or hate... or ironically
both. You program to async patterns for E\_V\_E\_R\_Y\_T\_H\_I\_N\_G,
and I mean everything. Procedural code will break stuff and break it
badly.

One of the strengths of node.js is the ability to write super fast
command-line applications. I have a several that are complete messes at
this point, but I am cleaning them up to be presentable on Github... So
I can't, in good conscience leave you with no "demo"... so here is the
monk lab page, written with the [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
framework and hosted by the awesome dudes at
[Nodejitsu](http://www.nodejitsu.com/).
