Every writer, well, maybe not every writer has most likely heard of [National Novel Writing Month](https://nanowrimo.org/) which is
affectionately shortened to NaNoWriMo.

### What does that have to do with me?

Glad you asked! Well, I think that I would really like to participate in NaNoWriMo. Maybe I like the *idea* of it more than
actually writing a minimum of 1500 words a day to get the required 50K during November. Yes, I would really like to write
a book if only it wasn't so stinkin' hard.

So what is a guy like me to do? I'll tell you that I happened to find something right up my alley. In the spirit of NaNoWriMo, [National Novel Generation
Month](https://nanogenmo.github.io/) AKA NaNoGenMo is a month dedicated to _*generating*_ a novel with code. YEAH!!! Due to my proclivity and desire to
automate all the things, I had some fun with this one.

I don't particularly like politics and pay very little attention to them despite being a government employee myself. I
can't tell you what Fox news is saying or CNN. What I can tell you is what Donald Trump sounds like if you take a bunch of
his speeches and run them through a markov chain model.

The result is terrifing to be honest. You can read my "story" [here](https://github.com/MichaelMartinez/Trumpov/blob/master/Hey_Everyone_Its_Donald_Trumpov.md),
also in the [repo](https://github.com/MichaelMartinez/Trumpov/) is the code and corpus used to make the "story"... enjoy!
