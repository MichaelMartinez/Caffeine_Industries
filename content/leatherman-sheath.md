My first batch of Vinegar Black (Vinegaroon) matured and I just had to
test it out on a project other than scraps. So I made this hybrid
pancake style Leatherman sheath. I used red thread as I wanted to see
the aftermath of using vinegaroon on a piece that had already been
stitched. I am happy to report that vinegaroon had no ill effects on the
contact cement nor the thread at this point... will report back if it
changes.

Vinegaroon is like magic, both to me and my little ones. The leather
literally turns black before your eyes. To my wife's chagrin, the kids
wanted to "paint" every piece of leather in the house after they
witnessed/created said event. That is the beauty of vinegaroon... its so
easy my three and five year old dauber'ed this sheath. Didn't have to
worry about streaks nor them inhaling noxious fumes (although vinegaroon
does smell pretty darn bad and I am not entirely sure its the best thing
to inhale, so we do this on the porch).

You have to bathe the leather in a baking soda/h2o solution to
neutralize the acid and that lead to even more learning. I showed them
what happens when you pour some white vinegar on baking soda (sodium
bicarbonate + diluted acetic acid = carbon dioxide). It was an easy
segue into why we can't mix nor play with chemicals around the house
without Mama or Papa supervision, they were totally focused on what was
going on. My five year old has been asking me to do more "experiments"
everyday after school. So it really piqued his curiosity in... well,
chemistry which is really awesome.

Anyway here are a few pics... the strap cut outs were done on a slight
angle so that I can wear it comfortably while driving the engine. I see
tons of imperfections and I will strive to get better.
