First, the bot can be seen in the wild here:

This is my first attempt to write a twitter bot that stands on its own.
In addition to learning more about Python and Server management, I saw
an opportunity to learn about Artificial Intelligence. The bot is
completely driven by its own mind and updates its status using a form of
Artificial Intelligence called [Markov
Chains](http://artint.info/html/ArtInt_160.html).  I admit that I am way
over my head (mathematically) with the complete comprehension of Markov
math.

I am applying myself to this because I want to understand it on a deeper
level. The future of programming, the future of a many industries,
careers, and day-to-day life will be transformed by artificial
intelligence. Robots are awesome and it is magical to see what this
thing will say next. I provide my robot with a [corpus of
text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_corpus) and the
bern\_trump\_bot takes over. Who knows what it will say next. I will
also add that its difficult not to have some form
of [anthropomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism) toward
the bot. This simple bot has opened my eyes to a world full of
possibilities.
