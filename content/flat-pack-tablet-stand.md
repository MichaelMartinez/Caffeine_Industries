I designed and built this tablet stand with a few goals in mind:

1.  Flat pack for easy transport
2.  Maximize surface area contacting the back of the stand
3.  Two parts
4.  Place to wrap cord in the back

The project was designed and drawn in CAD and laser cut from 3mm Birch
plywood. The finish is a gracious portion of mineral oil. However, a
nice stain may look good. I plan on making a few of these for Christmas
presents in both wood and acrylic. The finish for the presents will be
varied and I will post pictures of them when ready...

If you are interested in the template or interested in me making you
one, please let me know. I am in the process of setting up digital
downloads for multiple projects . I also make different products out
of leather, wood, felt, acrylic, and other materials. If you have a
custom project in mind, don't hesitate to email me.
