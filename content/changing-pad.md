Brand new baby and I needed a "tacti-cool" changing pad to go along with
the messenger/diaper bag I had already made. The outer shell is 1000d
Cordura in Coyote Tan. A small piece of high density foam was used as a
cushion for the little fella. The poo guard or liner was made with
recycled billboard material. Design considerations were that it had to
be easily opened with one hand because I am not as talented with
multi-tasking as my beautiful wife.  This was made circa 2008.
