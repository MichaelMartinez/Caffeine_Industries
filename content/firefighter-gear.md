These items are a sample of what I've made and repaired during my time
in the fire service. Innovation in the fire service is slow and
cumbersome due to the nature of the business. The old adage; "If it
'aint broke, don't fix it" applies. However, I'd like to think there is
a lot of room for efficiency on a variety of levels.
