Write! I like to write everything down, and I like nice notebooks.
Rhodia is my current favorite and they make a damn fine paper products.
So I set out to make a notebook cover. This is a very simple and
bombproof design for a large notebook. I have several designs in the
pipeline for the smaller pocketable Rhodia notebooks among other
manufactures Ie. Moleskine, Fieldnotes. More coming!!!!
