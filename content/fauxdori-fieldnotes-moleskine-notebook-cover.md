This is a design deviation of the popular and famous [Midori Travelers
notebook](http://www.travelers-company.com/). The Midori Travelers
notebook has a few fatal flaws in my opinion.

1.  The notebook refills are hard to purchase
2.  The size of the notebook is not standard to international paper
    sizes nor US sizes
3.  The cover nor the accessories are readily available at
    neighborhood stores. Ie. Target, Walmart, Art shops
4.  It is rather expensive for what amounts to leather and elastic

I addressed these problems by making a version that will accommodate
3.5" x  5.5" or 90mm x 140mm (roughly A6) notebooks. You can find
Moleskine Cahier Journal 3 packs at Target, for example. This notebook
cover with a rubber band will take all three notebooks and make it
pocketable. Again, the entire project was made in CAD before I cut a
single piece of leather. I cut it on the laser and laced it up with
elastic.

If you are interested in the template or interested in me making you
one, please let me know. I am in the process of setting up digital
downloads for multiple projects (Most of which reside on my computer
because I haven't had time to post). I also make different products out
of leather, wood, felt, acrylic, and other materials... soon to be
posted. Also considering Etsy...
