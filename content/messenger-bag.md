Messenger bags are awesome. I use this particular bag as my "swing" bag
which means it carries everything I need for 24 hour shifts. I usually
carry 3-4 pairs of socks, 3-4 underwear, 4 shirts, an extra pair of
pants and my dopp kit. I still have loads of room for more, which I
generally utilize in the summer due to changing sweaty clothes.
