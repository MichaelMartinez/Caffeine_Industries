As I've [mentioned](http://mmartinez.us/2013/10/rhodia-notebook-cover/)
in the past, I like to write things down. As I search for my favorite
notebook and system to keep track of my life, I like to tinker with
covers and items that enhance the perceived value of the activity
itself. This idea was born when I thought it might be cool to have my
wallet and notebook combined into one pocketable design. Also, thought
it would be awesome to use my laser cutter to make it.

The entire project was made in CAD before I cut a single piece of
leather. The beauty of CAD is the precision it affords. There is a bit
of apprehension as you cut it out for the first time and then line up
the holes in preparation for sewing. This is quickly followed with
gleeful relief and happiness as it fits perfectly as you have drawn it.

If you are interested in the template or interested in me making you
one, please let me know. I am in the process of setting up digital
downloads for multiple projects (Most of which reside on my computer
because I haven't had time to post). I also make different products out
of leather, wood, felt, acrylic, and other materials... soon to be
posted.
