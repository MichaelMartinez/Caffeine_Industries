I hiked the Grand Canyon with a few friends a few years ago. We decided
to "hike" the canyon in a manner known as ["Rim to
Rim."](http://www.rimtorim.org/) We also decided to accomplish this task
in one day. 22 miles (give or take a half mile) and you get the idea. I
made this pack after the trip in the hopes that it would serve me (or
you, just ask for one) well for the next hike. Its modular design will
lend itself to the in the aid of compartmentalizing the aspects of any
hike.
